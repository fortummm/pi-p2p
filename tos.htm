      compliance, legality or decency of any material contained in or accessed through the
      Site or Service.
    </p>

    <p><strong>7.2 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems</strong></p>
    <p>
    By accessing, utilizing or interacting with the Site, Service, or Content, you represent
    and warrant to SocialChain that you understand the inherent risks associated with and
    have experience with cryptographic systems. By agreeing to the Term, you further
    represent and warrant to SocialChain that you have an understanding of the usage and
    intricacies of native cryptographic tokens (including, but not limited to, Ether (ETH) and
    Bitcoin (BTC)), smart contract based tokens (including, but not limited to, those that
    follow the Ethereum Token Standard (<strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20</a></strong>)), and
    blockchain-based software systems.
    </p>

    <p><strong>7.3 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</strong></p>
    <p>
      SocialChain, Pi, and the Site, Service and Content may be materially impacted by a
      change in law, rule or regulation or as the result of one or more regulatory inquiries or
      regulatory actions taken in one or more jurisdictions. Any such action may impede,
      limit or make unavailable the ability of SocialChain to continue to develop, offer or
      support to the Site, Service or Content, or your continued access or use of the Site,
      Service or Content. By your use of the Site and Service, and acceptance of these
      Terms, you expressly understand and acknowledge this risk, and waive and release
      SocialChain for any claim for loss or damage that you may now have or later acquire
      which relates or arises from your use and access of, or lack of use and access of, the
      Site, Service or Content that is impacted by any change in law, rule or regulation,
      regulatory inquiry or regulatory action taken in one or more jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <p><strong>7.4 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography</strong></p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and understand that Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in
      code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers
      may present risks to cryptocurrencies, the Site, Services and Content, and such risks
      include the risk of theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent
      commercially reasonable, SocialChain intends to continue to update the protocol
      underlying the Site and Services to address ongoing advances and emerging risks in
      cryptography, and will seek to incorporate additional security measures where
      commercially reasonable to do so. You understand, acknowledge and agree that
      SocialChain does not guarantee or otherwise represent that Pi, the Pi Network, the Site,
      Service or Content are fully secure from such risk now or in the future. By using the
      Service or accessing Content, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you are
      aware of these inherent risks and your use and access to the Site, Service and Content
      is done so at your own risk, including those specifically described above.
    </p>

    <p><strong>7.5 Volatility of Crypto Currencies</strong></p>
    <p>
      You understand, acknowledge and agree blockchain technologies and associated
      currencies and tokens (including, for instance, Ethereum and others) are highly volatile
      due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and
      security risks. You also understand, acknowledge and agree that after the external
      connectivity is enabled for the mainnet of Pi ("Mainnet") or Pi is listed on one or more
      exchanges, if any, Pi will likely be of similar volatility and will be subject to the same risk
      factors faced by other cryptocurrencies. You also understand, acknowledge and agree
      that the cost of transacting with respect to such technologies or in such cryptocurrencies
      is variable and may increase at any time and that this increased cost may have a
      material impact on activities taking place on one or more blockchains. Pi will be subject
      to similar such risks. You understand, acknowledge and agree that these risks are
      present and waive and release SocialChain for any such claim for loss or damage that
      you may now have or later acquire which relates or arises from such risk or from Pi, or
      your use and access of the Site, Service or Content, including, but not limited to any
      fluctuations or increased costs as described above.
    </p>

    <p><strong>7.6 Application Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      You understand, acknowledge and agree that blockchain applications, including the Site
      and Service, are based on code which is inherently subject to errors or flaws, and you
      hereby represent and warrant that you understand, acknowledge and agree that you are
      solely responsible for your use and access of the Site, the Services or Content, you are
      solely responsible for evaluating the code provided by or otherwise used in the Site,
      Service or Content, including, but not limited to your evaluation of the trustworthiness of,
      and your use and access of third-party websites, products, smart-contracts, or Content
      that you, of your own volition and at your own risk, access or use through the Site and
      Service. You further understand, acknowledge and agree that blockchain applications
      that are available through the Site or Service may be written in a manner that is
      malicious or negligent, and you understand, acknowledge and agree that SocialChain
      shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from your interaction with such
      applications, including for loss of property (including Pi), or personally identifiable
      information concerning you or others. This section, and any other notice or warning
      provided to you by SocialChain, shall not be used by you as evidence against
      SocialChain for a claim or loss, nor does it suggest or imply an on-going duty on the
      part of SocialChain to alert you to any and all potential risks of utilizing the Site, Service
      or Content.
    </p>

      indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with SocialChain in
      the defense of such matter and to reimburse SocialChain for all such costs of defense
      incurred.

    <h1><strong>15. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></h1>


    <p>
      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.1 Initial Dispute Resolution ("Initial Dispute Resolution")</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim,
      question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a
      condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.2 Binding Arbitration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the
      time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision set forth in
      15.1 begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to
      resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of
      or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the
      parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Site, Service or Content shall
      be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
      Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and
      the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American
      Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), excluding any rules or procedures governing or
      permitting class actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
      authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
      applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any
      claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is
      subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would
      be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written, and
      binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
      jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right
      to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the
      costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be
      more limited in arbitration than in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.3 Location</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Binding arbitration shall take place in California. You agree to submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Mateo County, California, in order to
      compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate
      or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.4 Class Action Waiver</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual
      capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties
      expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU
      AND SOCIALCHAIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
      OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
      OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
      PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set
      forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can
      proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed
      null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to
      arbitrate disputes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.5 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either
      party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property
      rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks,
      and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in
      a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action
      waiver provisions set forth above via email at <strong><a href=mailto:support@socialchain.app>support@socialchain.app</a></strong>. The notice
      must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Site or Service, whichever is later,
      otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those
      paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, SocialChain also will not be
      bound by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.7 Changes to this Section</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      SocialChain will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section. Changes
      will become effective on the thirtieth (30th) day, and will apply prospectively only to any
      claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and SocialChain agree to submit to the
      personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located
      in California. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive
      any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Terms and the relationship between you and SocialChain shall be governed by the
      laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law provisions.
    </p>

      These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation that
      SocialChain may post on the Site) constitute the entire agreement between you and
      SocialChain with respect to the Service and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or
      written, between you and SocialChain. In the event of a conflict between these Terms
      and the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over
      the Terms to the extent of the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.2 Waiver and Severability of Terms</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of SocialChain to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms
      shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is
      found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
      nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the
      parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms
      shall remain in full force and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.5 Governing Law</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by California law, without regard to conflicts of law
      principles. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for disputes under or relating to these
      Terms are the federal and state courts in San Francisco, California. You consent to
      jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.6 Statute of Limitations</strong>

        year from the earlier of the date upon which the loss or damage occurred, or the date
        upon which the conduct for which the claim is brought occurred, or (b) prior to the
        expiration of any statutorily applicable statute of limitation. If not timely filed pursuant to
        (a) or (b) above, as applicable, then you understand, acknowledge and agree that such
        claim(s) shall be forever barred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.7 Entire Agreement</strong>

      <strong>17. Enclosed Period Transfers</strong>
    </h1>

    <p>
    If you passed the KYC and have Migrated Pi on the Mainnet during Pi’s Enclosed
    Mainnet as described in the updated Pi Whitepaper chapters published on December
    28, 2021, then you hereby explicitly acknowledge, understand and agree, that prior to
    Open Network, the following additional terms and conditions set forth below shall apply.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You agree not to offer any sales of your Pi, Mobile Balance or any derivatives of
        your Pi and Mobile Balance for other fiat or crypto currencies prior to the launch
        of Open Network.
      </li>

      <li>
        You agree that you and only you are the exclusive holder of your account and
        Mainnet Wallet and that you will not transfer your account or Mainnet Wallet to
        another individual, group, or organization, or grant access to your account and/or
        Mainnet wallet to another person or entity during the Enclosed Network period.
      </li>

      <li>
      You agree not to engage in any illicit and/or illegal transactions using your Pi, or
        in any activities that are intended to violate or otherwise circumvent the Terms or
        the Enclosed Network period rules and restrictions, as described in the updated
        Pi <a href="https://minepi.com/white-paper/">Whitepaper</a> chapters published on December 28, 2021.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Violation of any of these terms, prior to Open Network, may result in suspension and/or
      termination of your account, the invalidation of pending Migration Events, as described
      in Section 18 below and any and all other necessary measures that SocialChain, in its
      sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary and reasonable to prevent and mitigate
      the harms incurred by such violations. If your account is terminated prior to Open
      Network, or after Open Network but prior to your migration, for the above reasons, such
      account termination will result in the forfeiture, cancellation and rescindment of your
      then current Mobile Balance. In the event that your account is terminated for one or
      more of the above reasons, you understand, acknowledge and agree that such
      termination is the result of your acts or actions, and you hereby waive and release
      SocialChain for any claim for loss or damage that you may now have or later acquire
      which relates or arises from termination or suspension, in part or in whole, of your use
      and access to the Site or Service, and your forfeiture of your Mobile Balance as
      described herein.
    </p>



    <h1>
      <strong>18. Mobile Balance; Fireside Tokens</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
    You understand, acknowledge and agree that prior to KYC, your use of the Site and
    Service for mining will generate a “mobile balance of points” which is maintained and
    reflected on the Pi Network App (the “Mobile Balance”). The Mobile Balance is a
    points calculation indicator. You understand that the Mobile Balance has no cash value,
    is not transferrable within Pi Network, is not your property, and may not be exchanged
    or transferred for any currency or cryptocurrency or for any other purpose.
    Furthermore, obtaining a Mobile Balance through your use of the Site and Service does
    not entitle you to any right or interest in Pi or any other property or asset. You may lose
    your Mobile Balance if at any time you violate these Terms, we reasonably believe you
    are in violation of any applicable law, if we cannot verify your identity or you otherwise
    do not pass KYC, or if you engaged in suspicious activity. We may, without prior notice
    or liability to you, discontinue the Mobile Balance functionality, or modify the Mobile
    Balance functionality, even though such changes may affect your eligibility for, or ability
    to access, the Mobile Balance. We may limit accrual of your Mobile Balance, including
    through caps, fees, and expiration. We may also revise the terms governing your Mobile
    Balance from time to time in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law. By continuing
    to access, test, or use the Mobile Balance functionality after any modification to these
    Terms, you agree to be bound by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following initial and ongoing verification of your identity, prior to each Migration Event,
      SocialChain will award Users that have passed KYC with Pi based on such Users’
      Mobile Balance activity. This Pi will be deposited into the User’s designated Mainnet
      Wallet on the Pi Mainnet Blockchain. Thereafter, SocialChain will undertake continuous
      Mainnet Migrations and continue to deposit Pi to eligible Users’ Mainnet Wallets (each
      Mainnet Migration activity that enables a User to receive new Pi shall be referred to
      herein as a “Migration Event”). During the first 14 days after the Migration Event, such
      migrated Pi are still subject to roll-back and adjustment (“Rollback”) through the
      blockchain feature of claimable balances based on accounting error corrections and
      additional compliance checks. To be extra clear, to the extent you fail our KYC checks
      or otherwise violate these Terms, we may cancel, pause or rescind User’s ability to
      participate in future Migration Events and Rollbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be required to meet all eligibility criteria at the time of each Migration Event.
      The eligibility criteria include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You must have executed the Pi Network’s Acknowledgement to Receive
      Tokens;
      </li>
      <li>
      You must pass initial and ongoing KYC and anti-money laundering checks;
      </li>
      <li>
      You must not have violated the Terms, including, but not limited to passing a
      screen to confirm that you have not used any act or artifice for the purpose of
      cheating or scripting;
      </li>
      <li>
      We must be able to verify the accuracy of your Mobile Balance;
      </li>
      <li>
      You must not have engaged in any fraud or illegal activity; and
      </li>
      <li>
      We must obtain confirmation that you reside in a jurisdiction that permits your
      use of the Site and Service, and receipt and holding of Pi.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If, during this eligibility review, you are determined to have violated the Terms, failed to
    execute the Acknowledgement to Receive Tokens, engaged in acts prohibited by the
    Terms or as specified in the Whitepaper, cheated or scripted, or you have failed to
    successfully pass KYC, then your Mobile Balance migration will be denied ,your
    Mobile Balance will be forfeited , and you will not receive any Pi reward.
    </p>
    <p>
    You understand, acknowledge and agree that Fireside tokens have no value, are not
    your property, cannot be transferred to a third party, and cannot be converted to, or
    exchanged for any cryptocurrency or currency. Fireside tokens may be purchased by
    you and may solely be used to post messages or vote for popularity of content on the
    Fireside Forum. At launch, the cost to purchase Fireside tokens shall be 1 Pi to buy
    100 Fireside tokens. You may not use any other currency or cryptocurrency to acquire
    Fireside tokens. The price of Fireside Tokens is set by SocialChain, in its sole
    discretion, and may be modified from time to time by SocialChain. Furthermore, you
    understand, acknowledge and agree that the Fireside token is not usable outside of the
    Fireside Forum.

    <h1>
      <strong>19. Grace Period; Forfeiture</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      As specified in the updated Pi Whitepaper chapters published on December 28, 2021,
      you, and all Users of the Site and Service that mine and obtain a Mobile Balance prior
      to Mainnet Migration must (1) successfully pass SocialChain’s KYC process both
      initially and on an ongoing basis, and (2) migrate their Mobile Balance, prior to the
      announced and applicable grace period deadlines as described in the following initial
      announcement <strong><a href="https://minepi.com/blog/kyc-grace-period">https://minepi.com/blog/kyc-grace-period</a></strong> and extended deadline
      announcement <strong><a href="https://minepi.com/blog/grace-period-extension-dec-31">https://minepi.com/blog/grace-period-extension-dec-31</a></strong> (the "Grace
      Period"). SocialChain notified Users on July 11, 2024 that the Grace Period had
